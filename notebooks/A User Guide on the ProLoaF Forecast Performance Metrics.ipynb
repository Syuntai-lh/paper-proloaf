    "<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "## Probabilistic forecast metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Probabilistic forecasts corresponds to the estimation of the statistical distribution of a future event and hence generate forecasts represented by predictive distributions which can be defined by Probability density function(PDF) or a cumulative distribution function(CDF), where CDF of a random variable X evaluated at x is $\\displaystyle CDF_X(x) = Probability(X \\leq x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Probabilistic forecasts can be generated by nonparametric or parametric approaches. \n",
    "    * Nonparametric methods do not make any assumptions about the shape of the density and concentrate on finding a set of quantile values by minimizing quantile/pinball loss for those quantiles. More of these discrete estimates helps to summarize the CDF.\n",
    "    * On the other hand, parametric methods assume a parametric distribution and seek parameters that optimize the predictive distribution by minimizing loss like negative log likelihood of that distribution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Numerical scores:\n",
    "* One may present the evaluation of their probabilistic forecasts in terms of numerical score like CRPS,Ignorance score,Mean Interval Score,Quantile score etc.\n",
    "A score is said to be proper when perfect forecasts are given best score value and these scores have to proper to be sure of the validity of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantile score:\n",
    "Suppose, we want to estimate to conditional median or other quantiles, this score can be used to evaluate the loss function, also called pinball loss.\n",
    "> * Recall that  a quantile $q_{\\tau}$ indicates that there is a probability ${\\tau}$ that the target variable occurs below $q_{\\tau}$\n",
    "* For a random variable $y$ with cumulative distribution function $F$ is defined as $q_{\\tau}=F^{-1}(\\tau)=\\inf \\{y: F(y) \\geqslant \\tau\\}$ where $\\tau \\in[0,1]$\n",
    "    * Without any assumption on the distribution,using these set of quantiles spanning the unit interval, we can get discrete estimates of predictive CDF.\n",
    "    * Also Prediction Intervals can be calculated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To estimate a quantile $\\tau \\in[0,1]$, with true value $y_i$ and the predicted value at that quantile $\\hat{y_i}$,the quantile loss is defined as\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "L_{\\tau}(y, \\hat{y})= \\bigg[(\\tau-1)\\sum_{i\\in y_{i}<\\hat{y}_{i}}\\left|y_{i}-\\hat{y}_{i}\\right|\\bigg]+\\bigg[\\tau\\sum_{i \\in y_{i} \\geq \\hat{y}_{i}}\\left|y_{i}-\\hat{y}_{i}\\right|\\bigg]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and this has to be divided by the length of the dataset $N$ \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* When $\\tau = 0.5$, that is penalizing the estimates both above and below the true value equally, we get median.\n",
    "* For lower quantiles(or the ones which are expected to appear less probably), the estimates which are above true value are highly penalized than the others and for the higher quantiles, the estimates which are below the true value are highly penalized than the others,which is what we expect.  \n",
    "* It is negatively oriented, lower the better.\n",
    "* Please note that it is non-differentiable at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interval score\n",
    "\n",
    "Proposed by [Gneiting and Raftery](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2007.00587.x), the interval score helps us to calibrate the quality of prediction intervals.\n",
    "Since, we now know that we can estimate quantiles using the above quantile loss function, we can then very well deduce the prediction intervals.\n",
    "><u>Just a quick recall to Prediction intervals</u>:\n",
    "* Prediction intervals(PI) define the range of values within which an observation is expected to be with a certain probability which is generally referred to as nominal coverage rate.For a significance level $\\alpha$, the coverage rate is given by $(1-\\alpha)100\\%$ \n",
    "* To determin PI, it is necessary to choose the way it should be centered on the PDF as stated in this [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/we.230) by Prof.Pinson and collegaues and it is generally centered on the median.\n",
    "*  A central PI with a coverage rate of $(1-\\alpha) 100 \\%$ is estimated by using the quantile $ \\left(\\hat{q}_{\\tau = \\alpha / 2}\\right) $ as the lower bound and the $(1-\\alpha / 2)$ quantile $\\left(\\hat{q}_{\\tau = 1-\\alpha / 2}\\right)$ as the upper bound.\n",
    "* So, a PI with $(1-\\alpha) 100 \\%$ nominal coverage rate is given by\n",
    "$\\widehat{P I}_{(1-\\alpha) 100\\%}=\\left[\\widehat{q}_{\\tau=\\alpha / 2}, \\hat{q}_{\\tau =1-\\alpha / 2}\\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the interval score is defined as follows:\n",
    "$$ IS_{\\alpha} = \\bigg[\\left ( U_{i}-L_{i}\\right)\\bigg]+\\bigg[\\frac{2}{\\alpha}\\left(L_{i}-y_{i}\\right) {\\Large\\mathbb{1}} \\left\\{y_{i}<L_{i}\\right\\}\\bigg]+\\bigg[\\frac{2}{\\alpha}\\left(y_{i}-U_{i}\\right) {\\Large\\mathbb{1}}\\left\\{y_{i}>U_{i}\\right\\}\\bigg] $$\n",

    "   * where $U_{i}$ and $L_{i}$ represent upper and lower prediction bounds which can be estimated either by quantiles as stated above or from the estimated parameters like standard deviation e.g. $\\hat{y}_{i} \\pm c \\hat{\\sigma}$ where $c$ is the coverage probability.<br>\n",
    "   * $y_i$ is the future observations of the series, $\\alpha$ is the significance level and ${\\Large{\\mathbb{1}}}$ is the indicator function (being 1 if $y_i$ is within the postulated interval and 0 otherwise).For a $95\\%$ prediction interval,$\\alpha = 0.05$\n",
    "   \n",
    "So, while the last two parts of the score indicate the penalty for the estimates where the future points are outside bounds the first part of the score indicates the width of the prediction interval and adds to the penalty as we want it to be low.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Reliability or calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the forecasts and the observations.\n",
    "* In other terms, the nominal coverage rate of the prediction intervals should be equal to the empirical one (e.g. a $90 \\%$ PI should cover $90 \\%$ of the observations). \n",
    "* The reliability property is an important prerequisite as non reliable forecasts would lead to a systematic blas in subsequent decision-making processes([Source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/we.230))\n",

    ">Imagine a distribution built from all the available past data of the parameter to forecast. The climatological forecast uses this unique distribution to forecast any future events. A high resolution forecasting system generates forecasts that differ from the climatology and, as a consequence, forecasts that are significantly different from each other. Climatological forecasts are perfectly reliable though having no resolution. Consequently, a skillful probabilistic forecasting system should issue reliable forecasts and with high resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "From a statistical point of view, resolution amounts to evaluate the capacity of the forecast system to produce different density forecasts depending on the forecast conditions (i.e. the predictive distributions are not only conditioned by the value of the predictand) (Pinson et al, 2007 ). For instance, the prediction intervals may exhibit increasing widths with increasing forecast horizon. Also, regarding the solar irradiance (GHI), the width of the PIs may vary according the sun's position in the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no unique mathematical way to establish Resolution measure.However, there are studies which try to study Resolution by decomposing numerical scores into uncertainty,reliability and resolution.\n",

    "#### Sharpness:\n",
    "* Sharpness evaluates how informative the forecasts are. Practically, sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions. \n",
    "* Sharpness is a function of the forecasts only and does not depend on the observations. Consequently, a forecasting system can produce sharp forecasts yet being useless if those probabilistic forecasts are not reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A probabilistic forecast is sharp if prediction intervals are shorter on average than prediction intervals derived from naive methods, such as climatology or persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "As per [Pinson et.al]((https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/we.230)),the sharpness of the predictive distributions can be assessed by calculating the mean size of the central prediction intervals.\n",
