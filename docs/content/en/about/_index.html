ProLoaF is a load prediction project in the context of the H2020 EU CoordiNet Project.
It utilizes machine learning and an Encoder-Decoder architecture to predict the target variable based
on other forecast data and an arbitrarily long set of historical data.


Here you can find instructions on how to build and install ProLoaF as well as descriptions of the scripts and tutorials to get you started.
